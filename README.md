<h4 align="center">Learn Quran is a hybrid platform for testing your knowledge in the Holy Quran!</h4>

## Inspiration ✨
This project was originally created for educational purposes. About two years ago I released my first Android app/game created with Unity, it was horrible, to say the least. Recreating the same app I made when I was first starting has really made me take another look at the process and effor I put in back then. 

## Open-Source 📖
Not to take too much of your time, this whole project consisting of the Website, iOS app and Android app is open-source*. It is for those who are looking for a project that is balanced between the simplicity of a couple of screens and the complexity of integrating with Firebase. <br>
